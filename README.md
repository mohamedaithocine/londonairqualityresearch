# Final Year Project - London Air Quality Research Project
This project aimed to conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of NO2 and PM2.5 air quality across London boroughs from 2015 to 2023, investigate the influence of road traffic patterns, and evaluate the initial impacts of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) phases introduced in 2019 and 2021. By integrating air quality monitoring data with traffic statistics and employing various analytical techniques including time series visualization, correlation, regression, clustering, and Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA), the study sought to answer key questions regarding pollution dynamics in London.

In summary, while London's air quality shows signs of long-term improvement regarding NO2 and PM2.5, significant challenges remain, evidenced by persistent hotspots and the complex relationship with emission sources. This study underscores the limitations of using aggregated traffic volume data for explaining pollution variations and highlights the critical need for robust statistical methods, particularly those accounting for time series dependencies like autocorrelation, when evaluating policy interventions such as the ULEZ. Addressing London's air quality effectively requires a continued focus on multiple emission sources and the application of sophisticated analytical approaches to accurately gauge the impact of mitigation strategies.
